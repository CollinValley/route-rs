/// Runner is a user facing helper function for running the constructed router.
///
/// Runner takes only one argument, router, which is a Trait Object that implements LinkBuilder. Runner will construct
/// the router inside of the Runtime context by calling build_link(). As such, the router object that is passed in should
/// do all of the required initialization before it is passed into runner. (IE calling ingressors(), etc)
///
/// In general, the `Link` returned by the router should contain only TokioRunnables and no PacketStreams,
/// since production routers are self contained with all their output going to links that push the packets
/// out the routers physical ports.
///
/// However, if the link your `link_builder()` fn provides does return egressors, this function will automatically
/// hook them into `PacketCollector` links, and whatever packets come out of those egressors will be returned to you once
/// the router completes operation and joins. In a production router, the router likely never stops running so
/// nothing will ever get returned.  Use this functionality only for testing.
