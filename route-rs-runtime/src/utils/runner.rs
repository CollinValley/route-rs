/// Runner is a user facing helper function for running the constructed router.
///
/// Its only argument is a function pointer that takes no arguments and returns a Link type. This
/// master link should contain all the runnables and outputs of the router, which in turn allows
/// this function to initialize and start the Router.
///
/// In general, the `Link` returned by the router should contain only TokioRunnables and no PacketStreams,
/// since production routers are self contained with all their output going to links that push the packets
/// out the routers physical ports.
///
/// However, if the link your `link_builder()` fn provides does return egressors, this function will automatically
/// hook them into Collector links, and whatever packets come out of those egressors will be returned to you once
/// the router completes operation and joins. In a production router, the router likely never stops running so
/// nothing will ever get returned.  Use this functionality only for testing.
